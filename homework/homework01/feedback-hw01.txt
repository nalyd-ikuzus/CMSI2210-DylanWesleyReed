SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

Nice work here, looks like everything is working for you.

Good work finding/using scanf to get the user input!  I also like how you
   expanded on the output text in the "C" version ~ it's nice to meet youse
   as well, and I look forward to collaborating for a great semester!

One thing to consider, particularly with "nasm" code, is to include a brief
   header in the file that has the assembly and linking commands for anyone
   who may come along after you to maintain your code.  If nothing else, it
   could help YOU when you re-visit the code later....

Off to a great start!
