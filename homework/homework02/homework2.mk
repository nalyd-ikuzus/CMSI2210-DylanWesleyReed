11. What are the bottom two layers of a computer system? Give a brief desciption of each.
> The bottom two layers of a computer system are the digital logic and the control layers.
> Digital logic is the physical hardware of the computer that make up the computer to run programs.
> For control layer, each hardware contains a microcode created by firmware.

12. What are the three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture?
> The three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture is the following:
>> 1. Control unit fetches instruction from memory.
>> 2. Fetched instruction is decoded and moved to the registers in CPU.
>> 3. The ALU executes the instruction.

13. What is the purpose of an ALU?
> The purpose of an ALU is that it executes the decodedinstruction for the program to function.

14. What is a register?
> A register holds program counters in the CPU that stores the instruction's addresses. 

15. What is one difference between Application software and System software?
> In application software, it is user friendly, meaning that the software can be easily be
> understood by a human. Systems software meanwhile can only be understood by computers,
> but not humans.
